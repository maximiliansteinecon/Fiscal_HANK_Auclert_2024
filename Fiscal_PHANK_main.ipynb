Overall it is assumed that both all agents have the same productivity $e_{it}$ and join the labour force $(n_{it} = N_{t})$. For constrained agents it means that consumption equals the after tax labor income and the economies aggregate consumption is the sum of unconstrained and constrained agents' consumption $C_t = (1-\\lambda)C^u_t + \\lambda C^c_t$.\n",

    "Another fiscal alternative fixes proportional taxes at their steady-state level and allocates all additional tax adjustments to the richest agents. The authors study how the distribution of tax changes affects the deficit-financed multiplier. In the baseline, a given change in taxes or labor income is distributed proportionally across all households, so only the aggregate size matters. They then consider a progressive experiment in which households in the top income state both receive the deficit-financed tax cut and later face the tax increases required to stabilize debt.\n",

    "In the Angeletos–Lian–Wolf tax‑rate rule, the government starts from a baseline tax rate $\\tau$ and implements an unfunded tax cut by lowering the rate to $\\tau_t = \\tau - \\tau_t^X$. To first order, this implies that total tax revenue responds as $dT_t = \\tau dY_t - dX_t$, where $dX_t = -Y\\,d\\tau_t^X$ captures the direct increase in the deficit coming from the lower tax rate. Substituting this fiscal rule into the intertemporal Keynesian cross yields\n",
